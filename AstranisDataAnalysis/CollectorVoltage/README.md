This is the data from the LeCroy oscilloscope. It measures the voltage at the collector of the Astranis' transistor. The voltage is DC 115V from PS300 power supply.

To measure this, we use Channel 1 of the scope, enabled AC coupling at 1MOhm.

In this analysis, we correlate the height of the signal from this channel to the dose deposited on the transistor (this part is done by Philip Franke and Edward McCary).


# Notes

- On 2025-02-27: We switched the gas bottles, during which, we ran on internal trigger mode. This make the oscilloscope trigger 570 shots. We will need to first identify these NULL shots and exclude them from the dataset. UPDATED: Shot 108 to shot 678 have been identified as the NULL trigger shots. Removed from the data.

SCAN 1: 10 shot: 0 - 9
